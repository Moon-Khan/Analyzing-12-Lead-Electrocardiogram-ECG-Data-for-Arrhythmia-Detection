# Analysis on ECG Data for Arrhythmia Detection

## Introduction

This repository contains code for analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) data for arrhythmia detection. The dataset used for analysis is sourced from PhysioNet, specifically the ECG Arrhythmia Database. It comprises 45,152 patient ECGs with a sampling rate of 500 Hz, encompassing multiple common rhythms and additional cardiovascular conditions, all meticulously labeled by professional experts.

## Installation

To run the analysis code, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Analysis-on-ECG-data-for-Arrhythmia-Detection.git
    ```

2. **Install the required Python libraries:**

    ```
    pip install streamlit psycopg2 pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
    ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL:**

    - Install PostgreSQL if not already installed.
    - Create a database and import your dataset.
    - Update the database connection details in the Python code as needed.

## Code Overview

The analysis code includes the following key steps:

- Data loading from PostgreSQL database.
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of arrhythmia disease among patients, gender distribution, and other relevant factors.
- Visualization of ECG data using various techniques such as scatter plots, histograms, and 3D plots.
- Application of machine learning algorithms for arrhythmia detection.
- Deployment of the analysis using Streamlit.
